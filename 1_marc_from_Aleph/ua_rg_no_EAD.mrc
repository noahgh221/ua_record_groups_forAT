He was born in Breslau, Germany,(now Wroclaw, Poland) in 1900. In 1933 he was forced to resign his post at the University of Berlin by the advent of the Nazi regime. He left Germany for England, then for France where he was appointed "Maitre de Recherches" at the College de France (later becoming "Directeur de Recherche'). He immigrated to the United States in 1939, and came to Duke University, first as a Professor of Chemistry. In 1949 he received a joint appointment in Physics and Chemistry and became a James B. Duke Professor. In 1953 he became the 5th recipient of the Lorentz medal, awarded by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, and was the first American citizen to receive this honor. He died in Durham in 1954.8 aCollection includes files compiled by Duke professor Horst Meyer about Fritz London for the purpose of writing a biography.

Duke and originally called "Four Acres." Located on West Chapel Hill Street in Durham (N.C.), the property was gifted to Duke University by Mary Duke Biddle, daughter of Benjamin and Sarah P. Duke, in 1938 (two years after her mother's death), at which time it became known as University House. It was used as a guest house and hosting for various University-related functions, including luncheons, dinners, receptions, and meetings. The property was sold and the house demolished in 1960.8 aThe collection includes an account book from 1944 Sept. 1-1957 Jan. 31, which includes the number of meals served University guests, the number of overnight guests, and identification of groups (including number) using the facility. There is also a typed list of events at University House from 1938-1945 July 8, and a daily schedule of a busy week during a Pastors' School when the house was overflowing (undated). These records were kept by Lucy Lyon Corbin, who, with her daughter Charlotte Corbin on the Alumni Affairs staff, lived in University House.20aDuke University.bUniversity House.20aDuke UniversityxHistoryy20th century.20aDuke UniversityxHousing.1 aCorbin, Charlotte.01371npcaa2200217Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002704000190006804900090008709900070009611000430010324500450014630000390019150000220023050000620025254504000031452003750071454100170108955500290110659000180113500385593020130212152022.0030617i18481978ncu                 eng d  aNDDedacscNDD  aNDH6  a6i2 aDuke University.bUniversity Archives.10aGeneral Oversize Collection,f1848-1978.  aapprox. 40fitems (3.4 linear ft.)  aTEMPORARY RECORD.  aUnprocessed collection.

This new committee was responsible for University matters dealing with academic policy and physical planning. The UPPAC was in existence until 1969. In 1971, the University Planning Committee (UPC) was constituted by then-President Terry Sanford. The UPC was to assume the roles of the previous planning committees in that it was to “look at the past and make projections for the future in areas of enrollment, physical facilities, space, revenue sources of operating funds for the Medical Center, faculty retirement, campus plans, development, etc.” The UPC was disbanded in 1973, and reappeared the next academic year as the University Planning Commission.8 aThe collection consists of records relating to the academic, faculty, and institutional development of the University, as dealt with through this committee. Correspondence, memoranda, reports, minutes, agendas, proposals, and bound materials comprise this collection. Materials in this collection date from 1962 to 1973.  a.cTransfer;8 aInventory in repository.  a*sab 2007030600896cpc a2200217Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002704000190006804900270008709900200011410000250013424500430015930000290020250000220023150000560025350600500030959000090035952002650036860000250063360000200065800307773720140624090316.0020603i18701951ncu                 eng d  aNDDeappmcNDD  aNDDAd[1-=Boxes]v1-12  aLib.

There are no records of his tenure. The office was again established in March 1969 when President D. M. Knight wanted an officer to assist with an increasing executive workload. The Chancellor was given responsibility for the internal operation of the University. Under the University By-laws of May 10, 1988, the Chancellor is an executive officer with powers and duties assigned by the President. The occupants of the office have been the following: Robert L. Flowers (1949-1951), Barnes Woodhall (1969-1970, pro tem), A. Kenneth Pye (1970-1971), John O. Blackburn (1971-1976); A. Kenneth Pye (1976-1982), and H. Keith H.

The project was a major effort to establish a system for addressing the near and long-term administrative information needs of the University. Its goals were to study Duke's administrative processes with a view toward identifying how automated information systems might best support administrative operations. The method used was similar to business systems analysis, and involved interviews with key administrators regarding their information needs, and studies of the functioning of existing manual and automated systems.8 aCollection contains reports, correspondence, memoranda, studies and other records, the bulk of which concern the Administrative System Planning project, 1978. Project records include the final report, “Duke University Administrative Systems Planning Study…” (33p., 15 November 1978) and drafts, along with agenda, studies, minutes, notes, and reports on interviews with administrators, including Terry Sanford, Ken Pye, Eugene McDonald, W.G.

Its founding was brought about in large part by the American Mathematical Society's encouraging Duke University to establish a mathematical journal. In 1927, and again in 1931, the Society urged the University to create a journal, stating that the need for a new mathematical periodical existed. Furthermore, it argued that in order to attract papers from leading mathematicians, such a periodical would need assured financial support to guarantee its permanent existence, and that Duke University was in a strategic position to embark on such a project.8 aThis collection is largely comprised of correspondence of the individuals and organizations who communicated with the editors of the Duke Mathematical Journal. All correspondence related to accepted papers was kept, as well as a significant amount of correspondence related to rejected papers before 1970. Referee reports are also included, as well as billing and correspondence between the Journal and various publishing houses. Topics covered include edits to papers, requests for offprint copies, correspondence between editors, correspondence with the American Mathematical Society, and the Journal's budget and funding. The collection ends with a series of record books recording each paper received and reviewed by the Journal.20aAmerican Mathematical Society. 0aMathematicsvPeriodicals.20aDuke University Press.2 aDuke University.bMathematics Department.42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uadukemathjournal/00702npcaa2200229Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002704000190006804900090008709900080009611000400010424500480014430000320019250000220022450000310024650000620027750600230033952000430036254100200040555500290042559000180045400383297720070208162718.0030617s1944    ncu                 eng d  aNDDedacscNDD  aNDH6  a13e2 aDuke University.bMathematics Dept.10aMathematics Dept. records,f1944-[ongoing].  a100fitems (0.5 linear ft.)  aTEMPORARY RECORD.  aClosed pending processing.  aUnprocessed collection.
