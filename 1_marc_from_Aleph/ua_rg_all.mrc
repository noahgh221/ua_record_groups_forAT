He was born in Breslau, Germany,(now Wroclaw, Poland) in 1900. In 1933 he was forced to resign his post at the University of Berlin by the advent of the Nazi regime. He left Germany for England, then for France where he was appointed "Maitre de Recherches" at the College de France (later becoming "Directeur de Recherche'). He immigrated to the United States in 1939, and came to Duke University, first as a Professor of Chemistry. In 1949 he received a joint appointment in Physics and Chemistry and became a James B. Duke Professor. In 1953 he became the 5th recipient of the Lorentz medal, awarded by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, and was the first American citizen to receive this honor. He died in Durham in 1954.8 aCollection includes files compiled by Duke professor Horst Meyer about Fritz London for the purpose of writing a biography.

In the early 1960's, scientists from U.S. universities forged relationships with colleagues at the Universidad de Costa Rica in the interest of strengthening education and research in tropical biology. This led to the founding of OTS in 1963 in order to provide leadership in education, research and the use of natural resources in the tropics. The corporate headquarters of OTS is located at Duke University.8 aThe bulk of the collection (three folders) consists of copies of memoranda, letters and reports cited by Donald E. Stone in his article, "The Organization for Tropical Studies: A Success Story in Graduate Training and Research" published in Tropical Rainforests: Diversity and Conservation, Frank Almeda and Catherine Pringle, eds. (1988), along with a copy of the Stone article. These materials are in three folders. A fourth folder contains news clippings about the organization, 1979-1985.  a*kds 2007020820aOrganization for Tropical Studies. 0aResearchzTropics.42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/uatropicstudiesrc/inv/01097npcaa2200241Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002702400310006803500140009904000190011304900090013209900090014111000430015024500630019330000320025652002940028854100280058255500440061059000180065461000450067265500450071785600930076200383298320091022164650.0080318s1913    ncu                 eng d8 auaengineeringrcdDUKEPLEAD  a213434121  aNDDedacscNDD  aNDH6  aCage2 aDuke University.bUniversity Archives.10aSchool of Engineering Reference Collection,f1913-ongoing.  a650fitems (0.7 linear ft.)8 aThe School of Engineering Reference Collection contains files of clippings, articles, bulletins, reports, publications, and other materials about the School of Engineering.

The institution first awarded A.B. degrees the following year, and thus 1853 is our "degree date." Two brothers, D. C. and Lemuel Johnson, were the recipients, and made up the first graduating class. The 2009 commencement was the one hundred and fifty seventh. The University began printing commencement numbers on the programs in 1932, when that year's was marked as the eightieth commencement. The count therefore was started with the 1853 ceremony. Union Institute and Normal College did celebrate commencement before 1853; however no degrees were awarded at those ceremonies.8 aThe collection contains programs, transcripts or copies of commencement and baccalaureate addresses, invitations, announcements, honorary degree citations, instructions to participants, news clippings, lists of speakers, Bibles, sample diplomas, and other materials pertaining to commencement ceremonies. From 1850 through 1927, one folder typically holds materials from several years' ceremonies, whereas in more recent years, one's year's ceremony may take more than one folder.  a*kds 2007030520aDuke UniversityxHistoryy19th century.20aDuke UniversityxHistoryy20th century.20aDuke UniversityxCommencement ceremonies.42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/uacomexref/inv/01191npcaa2200253Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002702400300006803500140009804000190011204900090013109900090014011000430014924500560019230000320024854502110028052002010049154100170069255500440070959000180075361000410077161000330081285600920084500384089020091023095134.0080201i19801997ncu                 eng d8 auafoundsocietydDUKEPLEAD  a191749443  aNDDedacscNDD  aNDH6  aCage2 aDuke University.bUniversity Archives.10aFounders' Society Reference Collection,f1980-1997.  a500fitems (0.5 linear ft.)  aThe Founders' Society was created in 1980 to honor individuals, corporations, foundations, and organizations whose gifts of endowment have strengthened and ensured continuing excellence for Duke University.8 aCollection contains programs, invitations, speeches, lists of members, menus and other materials relating to the operation of the Founders' Society.

The practice was formalized by the Board of Trustees on June 4, 1901, when October 3 was designated as Benefactors' Day in honor of Washington Duke. The original intent "to honor Washington Duke forever" has been kept in spirit but through the years the name and even date of the annual observance has changed. It has been called Benefactors' Day (1901-1924), Duke University Day (1926-1947), and since 1948, Founders' Day. The most common forms of recognition have been an address on campus, the laying of a wreath at the tombs of the Dukes, and for many years the planting of trees by the senior class presidents to beautify the campus. The day has been the occasion for the presentation of special donations and awards, the dedication of buildings or gifts such as the Flentrop Organ in 1976, and the awarding of honorary degrees.8 aThis collection was compiled from a variety of sources by the University Archives for use in reference and research. It includes the general history of Founders' Day, lists of speakers (1926-2006), recipient lists for various honoraries including: the University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service at Duke; Distinguished Alumni Award; distinguished Teaching Awards; University Teacher/Scholar Award; Trinity College Distinguished Teaching Award; Howard Johnson Distinguished Teaching Award; and Humanitarian Service Award. The collection also has speeches/remarks/sermons/ programs for the Founders' Day celebrations throughout the years (1901; 1916; 1930-2006), as well, as a scrapbook of the 1956 Founders' Day celebration that commemorated the 100th anniversary of James Buchanan Duke's birth.  a.cAcquired;dpre-2008.8 aInventory in repository and on the web.  a*kds 2008031820aDuke UniversityxFounders' Day.20aDuke UniversityxAwards. 7aScrapbooks2aat42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/uafoundersrc/inv/01122npcaa2200217Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002702400300006803500140009804000130011204900090012511000430013424500880017730000320026554501210029752002800041859000180069861000570071661000390077385600920081200384358520111026133521.0111026i19391998ncu                 eng d8 auapublicgovtrcdDUKEPLEAD  a758676138  aNDDcNDD  aNDDP2 aDuke University.bUniversity Archives.10aOffice of Public Affairs and Government Relations Reference Collection,f1939-1998.  a300fitems (0.5 linear ft.)  aThis collection was compiled from a variety of sources by the University Archives for use in reference and research.8 aThe Office of Public Affairs and Government Relations Reference Collection contains files of memoranda, clippings, publications, and reports relating to the Office of Public Affairs and Government Relations and its predecessors, such as the Office of News and Communications.  a*sab 2007031320aDuke University.bOffice of News and Communications.20aDuke UniversityxPublic relations.42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/uapublicgovtrc/inv/01001npcaa2200205Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002702400230006803500140009104000130010504900090011811000430012724500600017030000390023054501210026952002580039059000180064861000440066685600850071000384781620111026134945.0111026s1959    ncu                 eng d8 auaurrefdDUKEPLEAD  a758675524  aNDDcNDD  aNDDP2 aDuke University.bUniversity Archives.10aUniversity Reports Reference Collection,f1959-ongoing.  aapprox. 70fitems (5.8 linear ft.)  aThis collection was compiled from a variety of sources by the University Archives for use in reference and research.8 aThe University Reports Reference Collection contains major reports concerning accreditation, university administration and governance, strategic planning, the curriculum, facilities, and student life.

The School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the Duke University Marine Lab (both formed in 1938) came together in 1991 to become the School of Environment, which was named the Nicholas School in 1995 following a $20 million gift from Peter M. and Ginny Nicholas of Boston. In 1997, the Department of Geology (formed in 1936) joined the school as the Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences, bringing with it new resources and a new name for the school in December 2000-the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences. In December 2003, the Nicholases ended the Campaign for Duke with a $70 million pledge to the university, to help fund the design and construction of Nicholas Hall, the future home of the Nicholas School, as well as the launch of the affiliated Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions.

Some fraternities had the same blocks of rooms for decades. Then, beginning with the work of the University Committee on Long-Range Planning (1958-1962), residential arrangements and administration came under close review. That process has continued. Groups involved in it have included the Undergraduate Faculty Council, its successor, the Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS), and its successor, the Arts and Sciences Council, the West Campus Community Council (WCCC), the Community Council of the Woman's College (CoCoWoCo), the Residential Life Committee, the Residential Policy Committee, and successor groups. This collection was compiled from a variety of sources by the University Archives for use in reference and research.8 aReports, subject files, housing proposals, policy statements, regulations, newspaper clippings, flyers, brochures, announcements, handbooks and guides for resident advisors, dormitory floor plans, correspondence, memoranda and chronologies of changes in residential life, 1920s-1990s. Major subjects include residential planning and programming, on- and off-campus housing, housing for graduate and professional students and married students, the administration of residential life, federations and other housing arrangements, the work of resident advisors and faculty-in-residence, experimental living-learning arrangements, and non-Greek houses and associations.

This collection includes materials about departments, centers, programs, sections, institutes, cooperative programs (mostly Duke-UNC), and a few other units. These last ones are in the series titled "Others" and are things that did not fit anywhere else. For instance, School of Spanish Studies was not a school in the sense we now use the term. There are also files on the Woman's College and School of Nursing. The department is the basic academic administrative unit in Arts and Sciences, the Pratt School of Engineering, and the School of Medicine. Historically, other instructional and research units have included those designated as "Office of ..." and "... Laboratory," as in, for example, the Parapsychology Laboratory. Institutes, Programs, and Centers are academic units created to foster interdisciplinary work. Sections were created in 1988 to facilitate the development of new academic efforts of limited size in subject areas where the creation of a department was not warranted. The collection includes printed matter, clippings, handbooks, newsletters, flyers, reports, lists of department administrators and other material for many departments/academic divisions at Duke University. Departments with larger amounts of material have their own reference collections. This collection ranges in date from 1904-ongoing.  a.cAcquired;d.8 aInventory in repository and on the web.  a*kds 20081120  a*kds 2008100120aDuke UniversityvHandbooks, manuals, etc.20aDuke UniversityxHistoryy20th century. 7aClippings (Books, newspapers, etc.)2aat42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/uadptaca/inv/01129npcaa2200253Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002702400270006803500140009504000190010904900090012811000430013724500550018030000400023552002830027554100200055855500440057859000180062259000180064061000390065861000440069765500450074185600890078600403877820091023104424.0081120s1958    ncu                 eng d8 auagradschrcdDUKEPLEAD  a275296084  aNDDedacscNDD  aNDH62 aDuke University.bUniversity Archives.10aGraduate School Reference Collection, 1958-ongoing  aapprox. 300fitems (0.7 linear ft.)8 aThe Graduate School Reference Collection was compiled from a variety of sources by the University Archives for use in reference and research.

The matter is significant in Duke's history as one of three administrative shakeups within a two-decade period that involved the University's presidency. The first of these was the debate in the late 1940s over how to gracefully end President Robert Lee Flowers' term in office, the second, the Gross-Edens Affair, and the third, the resignation of Dr. Douglas M. Knight from the presidency in 1969. The Gross-Edens Affair impacted the Bylaws of the University, makeup and role of the University's Board of Trustees, the organization of the University's senior administrative offices, and the role of the faculty in the governance of the institution.8 aContains newspaper clippings, administrative memoranda and correspondence, and committee reports pertaining to an administrative controversy at Duke.

In October of 1964 the University Planning Committee combined with the University Policy Committee, forming the University Policy and Planning Advisory Committee (UPPAC). This new committee was responsible for University matters dealing with academic policy and physical planning. The UPPAC was in existence until 1969. In 1971, the University Planning Committee (UPC) was constituted by then-President Terry Sanford. The UPC was to assume the roles of the previous planning committees in that it was to “look at the past and make projections for the future in areas of enrollment, physical facilities, space, revenue sources of operating funds for the Medical Center, faculty retirement, campus plans, development, etc.” The UPC was disbanded in 1973, and reappeared the next academic year as the University Planning Commission.8 aThe collection consists of records relating to the academic, faculty, and institutional development of the University, as dealt with through this committee.

The method used was similar to business systems analysis, and involved interviews with key administrators regarding their information needs, and studies of the functioning of existing manual and automated systems.8 aCollection contains reports, correspondence, memoranda, studies and other records, the bulk of which concern the Administrative System Planning project, 1978. Project records include the final report, “Duke University Administrative Systems Planning Study…” (33p., 15 November 1978) and drafts, along with agenda, studies, minutes, notes, and reports on interviews with administrators, including Terry Sanford, Ken Pye, Eugene McDonald, W.G. Anlyan, Ewald Busse, Paul Carrington, Thomas Dixon and others.  a.cTransfer;d1979-1981.8 aInventory in repository.  a*sab 2007030800907npcaa2200217Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002704000190006804900090008709900080009611000630010424500750016730000310024250000220027350000620029550600230035752002380038054100240061855500290064259000180067100384213320070308141605.0030617i19781985ncu                 eng d  aNDDedacscNDD  aNDH6  a11g2 aDuke University.bVice-Chancellor for Information Systems.10aOffice of Vice-Chancellor for Information Systems records,f1978-1985.  a10fitems (0.5 linear ft.)  aTEMPORARY RECORD.  aUnprocessed collection.

Athletic Association Records,f1912-1937.  aapprox. 400fitems (0.5 linear ft.)  aThe origin of the Trinity College (Durham, N.C.) Athletic Association is unclear. It is likely that it was established soon after Trinity joined the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association during the 1902-1903 academic year, as did other similar institutions. What is known is that in 1907, the Board of Trustees approved the formation of the Athletic Council, which served as the governing body of athletics on-campus. Between the two, athletic events/games were organized. The Athletic Association is probably the predecessor to the current Dept. of Athletics.8 aThe collection includes correspondence and contracts related to baseball and basketball games played by Trinity College teams from 1912-1918. There is also a folder of correspondence regarding an 1888 football game. The correspondence and contracts give insight into the business-end of college athletics regarding game schedules, location, and fees.

The collection also includes material about the history of Duke Forest and its use as a teaching and research facility. The earliest materials comprise the papers of Clarence F. Korstian, first director of the Forest and first dean of the School, including his correspondence, early reports about the Forest and the School, and his involvement in the Ecological Society of America, the North Carolina Forestry Association, and the International Union of Forest Research Organizations. The bulk of the collection consists of the School's general administrative records, including annual reports, admissions records, enrollment statistics, information on degrees granted, faculty history and meetings, and surveys and meetings of the School's alumni. Visual materials include posters, color and black-and-white photographs, negatives, and slides that document the School of Forestry and the Duke Marine Laboratory.10aKorstian, Clarence F.q(Clarence Ferdinand),d1889-1968.20aDuke UniversityxFaculty.20aDuke UniversityxHistoryy20th century.20aDuke University.bSchool of Forestry.20aDuke University.bSchool of Forestry and Environmental Studies.20aDuke University.bSchool of the Environment.20aDuke University.bMarine Laboratory.20aDuke University.bNicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences (Duke University)20aDuke University.bNicholas School of the Environment (Duke University) 0aEnvironmental scienceszNorth Carolina. 0aEnvironmental sciencesxStudy and teaching. 0aForest managementzNorth CarolinazDurham. 0aForests and forestryxResearchzNorth Carolina. 0aDuke Forest (N.C.)xHistory. 0aDuke Forest (N.C.)xResearch.42aFinding aiduhttp://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/uansoe/inv/00591cpc a2200169Ia 450000500170000000800410001704000190005804900260007709900200010311000800012324500810020330000270028450000220031150000560033350600230038959000090041220040712212500.0030205i19951996ncu                 eng d  aNDDeappmcNDD  aNDDAd[1-=Boxes]v1-4  aLib.

Her goal was to document the experiences and perceptions of women who attended Duke University during this period. In particular she wanted to know why they selected and how the Woman's College figured into that decision. She also explored her subject's position and negative experiences at Duke. Her interviewees include several class leaders, a member of the Duke family, and others who have had long established ties to the school after graduation.

A majority of the material is in English; however, there are items in German interspersed throughout. A bulk of the material dates from 1960-1985. The collection is divided into three series: Herman Salinger, Leland Phelps, and Department Chair and Director of Graduate Study. The Herman Salinger series contains material accumulated and created by Salinger during his tenure at Duke University, as department chair (1955-1970) and as a faculty member. Major subjects include graduate students, job applicants and inquiries, course materials, departmental publications, correspondence, and a file containing materials prior to Salinger's chairmanship. Among the name files are Clement Vollmer, Allan M. Cartter and Peter Ilkow, a German instructor at Duke from 1956 until his suicide in 1958.8 aThe Leland Phelps series contains material accumulated and created by Leland Phelps while serving as department chair (1970-1983) and as a faculty member. Material includes general correspondence, departmental meetings, and commitments. Among the major subjects are publications: Creative Encounters: Festschrift for Herman Salinger and Aus Unserer Zuit; foreign study and study abroad programs; the Munster Program; and material concerning the establishment of a language lab at Duke University. The Phelps series is also divided into two sub-series: Harold Jantz Collection files and Committee files. The Jantz Collection files contain material relevant to the acquisition and promotion of the collection including conferences and publications. Various committees on which Phelps served constitute the committee files sub-series. As both Phelps and Salinger served in the department simultaneously from 1961-1970, there is some overlap of materials.8 aThe third series contains material pertaining to the departmental chair, including Salinger and Phelps, and the director of graduate study, 1966-1983.  a.cTransfer;d1983-1994.  a*kds 200811208 aInventory in repository and on the web.  a*sab 2006103020aDuke University.bDepartment of Germanic Languages and Literature.20aDuke University.bDepartment of Germanic Languages and LiteraturexFaculty.20aDuke University.bComputer Assisted Language Instruction (CALIS)20aDuke University.bLibraryxHarold Jantz Collection.10aCartter, Alan M.10aJantz, Harold Stein,d1907-1987.10aPhelps, Leland R.10aSalinger, Herman,d1905-1983.10aVollmer, Clement,d1898-1972.42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/uaglanglit/inv/02641npcaa2200337Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002702400220006803500140009004000190010404900090012311000790013224500770021130000340028850000260032254503590034852010550070754100290176255500440179159000180183559000180185360000210187160000230189261000790191561000300199461000310202465000350205565000480209065000810213885600840221900383292120091023113643.0090302i19321986ncu                 eng d8 auahperdDUKEPLEAD  a311594021  aNDDedacscNDD  aNDH62 aDuke University.bDepartment of Health, Physical Education and Recreation.10aDept. of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation records,f1932-1986.  a2,750fitems (3.0 linear ft.)  aAccess is restricted.  aThe Dept. of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation (HPER) was created in 1975 by the merger of the Men's and Women's Physical Education Departments.

Its founding was brought about in large part by the American Mathematical Society's encouraging Duke University to establish a mathematical journal. In 1927, and again in 1931, the Society urged the University to create a journal, stating that the need for a new mathematical periodical existed. Furthermore, it argued that in order to attract papers from leading mathematicians, such a periodical would need assured financial support to guarantee its permanent existence, and that Duke University was in a strategic position to embark on such a project.8 aThis collection is largely comprised of correspondence of the individuals and organizations who communicated with the editors of the Duke Mathematical Journal. All correspondence related to accepted papers was kept, as well as a significant amount of correspondence related to rejected papers before 1970.

The President and the Vice President in the Educational Division (later the Provost) were members ex officio. There were three officers: the Chair, filled by the President, and a Vice Chair and Secretary, elected annually. The University Council was considered a standing committee of the Faculty and served as an advisory body on matters of general University policy and interest. It was intended to be a means by which the President could keep the Faculty informed of major policy matters, served as an investigative body, and tried to facilitate two-way communication between the Faculty and the Administration. It was supplanted by the Academic Council in 1962.8 aThe collection contains original typed minutes, printed summary minutes, committee records and reports, correspondence, memoranda, agenda, rosters, election results, and other records ranging in date from 1952-1962.

He received an A. M. degree in 1883 from Morrisville College and his Ph.D. from Chicago University in 1905. Dr. Godbey came to Duke University in the fall of 1926 as a scholar and teacher of Old Testament history in the School of Religion. Gradually, there developed a serious amount of friction between him and the rest of the faculty of the School.

The bulk of this correspondence deals with attempts by Carr, largely unsuccessful, to call in notes pledged to the endowment of the College. There are significant letters from Alspaugh, Gray, and John Franklin Crowell, as well as a Treasurer's Report (circa 1885), other financial matters, and lists of Methodist Church assessments made to support Trinity College. Other subjects treated include the settlement of an estate, bills for the widow of Braxton Craven, and a student petition for the replacement of Professor W. T. Gannaway. There are also letters from John W. Sanborn, a candidate for the College's presidency. The other items in the collection include clippings and photographs pertaining to the Carr family and homes; a farm journal (1910-1911) with instructions from Carr to his manager, B. S.

She conducted research and taught at Duke until 1965, supervising thirty-five masters and doctoral degree graduates.8 aThe collection primarily documents Sponer's American career, especially her work in the areas of chemical physics, spectrum analysis, and molecular spectroscopy. Arranged in five series: Correspondence, Printed Materials, Professional Files, Research Files, and Writings and Speeches. The Correspondence Series covers the final two decades of her career, from the late 1940s to 1967, and primarily consists of letters about research with her numerous collaborators and co-authors. Some of her final letters discuss death of her husband, physicist James Franck, in 1964, and also allude to the death that same year of her Duke Physics Department associate and fellow German refugee, Hedwig Kohn. The Printed Materials Series holds offprints and reprints of Sponer's articles from the 1930s-1960s, plus a few articles by Franck. Sponer's teaching and administrative files, including correspondence with graduate students, appear in the Professional Files. The Research Files make up the largest series in the collection; these files document her research on many topics and articles and also contain much of the collection's correspondence. The Writings and Speeches Series gathers several papers and talks from the last half-dozen years of Sponer's professional career.10aFranck, James,d1882-1964.10aKohn, Hedwig.20aDuke University.bDepartment of Physics.20aDuke University.bDepartment of PhysicsxFaculty. 0aChemistry, Physical and theoretical. 0aMolecular spectroscopy. 0aSpectrum analysis. 0aWomen physicists. 0aPhysicistszGermany. 0aPhysicistszUnited States. 0aPhysicsxStudy and teaching.42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uasponerhertha/01273npcaa2200241Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002702400270006803500140009504000130010904900090012210000270013124500690015830000400022754500840026752003690035159000230072061000630074361000300080665000430083660000700087985600820094900545637620120712083222.0120712i19811985ncu                 eng d8 auawoodpeterdDUKEPLEAD  a798918925  aNDDcNDD  aNDDP1 aWood, Peter H.,d1943-10aPeter Wood Papers on the Nixon Library Controversy,f1981, 1985.  aapprox. 450fitems (0.5 linear ft.)  aPeter H.

The program is from the 1964 meeting of the Duke University Alumni Association at which Secrest gave the invocation. The "In Memoriam" lists the names of individuals from the 1914 class who were deceased at the time of publication and was likely distributed at the Alumni Association event in 1964.

Most were taken outdoors, but there are several taken inside dorm rooms. The campus scenes include shots of the Chapel and a number of snow scenes. The people pictured include James L. Oswald, Jr, his roommate, Harold W. Pruner, and other friends, one of whom was Pedro Amador, of Puerto Rico. The activities shown are mostly related to athletics. There are scenes of the tennis courts, the track, the baseball field, and the football stadium during a game, along with half-time shows, crowd scenes, and what appear to be homecoming displays.

Lauterbach, a former Baldwin Scholar, began this project in 2006 as a means of examining undergraduate culture by looking to images and asking the Duke community to participate in discussion about what these images say in regard to stereotypes, the social scene, sexual relationships, and the treatment of women. Lauterbach collected numerous posters advertising various fraternity, sorority, and selective living group parties from 2005-2007.

It originated in March 1967 when the student body voted to merge the Men's Student Government Association and the Women's Student Government Association. ASDU consisted of an executive branch and a legislative branch. A student referendum in April 1993 replaced ASDU with a new organization, Duke Student Government, in which the legislative and executive branches were consolidated.8 aASDU records consist of minutes, correspondence, legislation, reports, printed matter, judicial decisions, charters, memoranda, speeches, receipts, vouchers, and other records. The ASDU records provide insight into student life during a time when students were becoming more active in university affairs. The records also document student organizations at Duke at this time and demonstrate some of the services provided to students by ASDU. Additional ASDU records can be found inter-filed with Duke Student Government records.  a.cTransfer;d1971-2004.8 aInventory in repository and on web.  a*jak 2005070820aDuke University.bAssociated Students.20aDuke University.bStudent Government.20aDuke UniversityxStudents.20aDuke UniversityxStudentsxSocieties, etc. 0aStudent participation in administration.42yCollection guideuhttp://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/uaasdu/inv/02415npcaa2200325Ia 450000100100000000500170001000800410002702400220006803500140009004000190010404900090012309900070013211000620013924500640020130000360026550000260030154505560032752006450088354100290152855500440155759000180160161000620161961000740168161000390175561000490179461000480184365000690189165500450196085600840200500381827820091028133225.0071219i19191974ncu                 eng d8 auawsgadDUKEPLEAD  a184904065  aNDDedacscNDD  aNDH6  a6a2 aDuke University.bWoman's Student Government Association.10aWoman's Student Government Association Records,f1919-1974.  a12,100fitems (13.8 linear ft.)  aAccess is restricted.  aThe Woman's Student Government Association (WSGA) was formed in 1918, and the organization continued when the Woman's College opened in 1930.

This autonomy along with the segregated campus life style of the coordinate college allowed female students to develop leadership skills and confidence that an integrated student government may not have allowed them to gain.8 aCollection contains minutes, correspondence, reports, printed matter, memos, clippings, and other official records of the WSGA and its committees, along with records of several student organizations and documents generated by the administrations of the Woman's College and Duke University.

The Society grew with the school, witnessing the founding of Trinity College and its development into Duke University. In 1881, the CLS started the College Herald, forerunner of the Chronicle. The Hesperian Literary Society was founded in 1851 at the suggestion of President Craven, because in his opinion, all first class colleges had two societies. According to tradition, it was called "Hesperian" because it was originally intended to be joined by boys from Western North Carolina. Both societies continued to co-exist until the Hesperian Literary Society dissolved in 1931-1932, although a similar organization, the Hesperian Union, organized in 1937. The Columbian Literary Society ended in 1938.8 aContains correspondence, reports, financial information, roll books, record books, and minute books of the Columbian and Hesperian Literary Societies.

Weeks, a professor of history at Trinity College, organized the Trinity College Historical Society. The goals of the Society were to collect, arrange, and preserve written materials and artifacts illustrative of the history of North Carolina and the South, and to promote the study of Southern history through lectures and publications. The Society benefited from the strong leadership of two history professors, John Spencer Bassett and William Kenneth Boyd. They made wide appeals for donations of historical materials and maintained a museum to house these relics. The meetings of the Society, held several times each year, provided a forum at which students and faculty could read their research papers and discuss their ideas. The best of these papers were published, from 1897 to 1956, in the HISTORICAL PAPERS OF THE TRINITY COLLEGE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.8 aThe collection includes historical notes about Trinity College and the Society, correspondence, meeting announcements, administrative files, publications, speeches, and artifacts.
