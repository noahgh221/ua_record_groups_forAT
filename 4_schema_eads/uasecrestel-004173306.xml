This item has been separated and placed in the map cabinet. The two other photographs, both undated, include an unidentified man as well one of E. L. Secrest and maybe his brothers. The program is from the 1964 meeting of the Duke University Alumni Association at which Secrest gave the invocation. The "In Memoriam" lists the names of individuals from the 1914 class who were deceased at the time of publication and was likely distributed at the Alumni Association event in 1964.
