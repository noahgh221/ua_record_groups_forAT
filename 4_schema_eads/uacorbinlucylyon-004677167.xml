         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>University House was built in 1908 by Benjamin N. Duke and originally called "Four Acres." Located on West Chapel Hill Street in Durham (N.C.), the property was gifted to Duke University by Mary Duke Biddle, daughter of Benjamin and Sarah P. Duke, in 1938 (two years after her mother's death), at which time it became known as University House. It was used as a guest house and hosting for various University-related functions, including luncheons, dinners, receptions, and meetings. The property was sold and the house demolished in 1960.</p>
