         <p>This acquisition contains material from the Images Project, a student research initiative undertaken by Claire Lauterbach (Trinity â€™08) which raises questions about the social climate on campus and the objectification of women. Lauterbach, a former Baldwin Scholar, began this project in 2006 as a means of examining undergraduate culture by looking to images and asking the Duke community to participate in discussion about what these images say in regard to stereotypes, the social scene, sexual relationships, and the treatment of women. Lauterbach collected numerous posters advertising various fraternity, sorority, and selective living group parties from 2005-2007. These images were later displayed in the Bryan Center and the Duke Community was invited to write comments.</p>
