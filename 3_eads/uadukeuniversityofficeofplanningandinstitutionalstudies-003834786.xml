         <p>Office was created by President Knight in 1963 when he divided the responsibilities of Everett H. Hopkins who had been acting as both Vice-President for Institutional Advancement and Assistant Provost for Planning for Planning and Institutional Studies, and created two positions. Hopkins became the Vice-President for Planning and Institutional Studies and Frank L. Ashmore became Vice-President for Institutional Advancement. According to Dr. Knight, “The Vice-President for Planning and Institutional Studies will be a senior staff officer responsible for assisting the President in the continuing development of long-range plans for the University as a whole.”</p>
