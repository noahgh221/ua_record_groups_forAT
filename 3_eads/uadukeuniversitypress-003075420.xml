         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Duke Mathematical Journal was founded in 1934 and published its first issue in 1935. Its founding was brought about in large part by the American Mathematical Society's encouraging Duke University to establish a mathematical journal. In 1927, and again in 1931, the Society urged the University to create a journal, stating that the need for a new mathematical periodical existed. Furthermore, it argued that in order to attract papers from leading mathematicians, such a periodical would need assured financial support to guarantee its permanent existence, and that Duke University was in a strategic position to embark on such a project.</p>
