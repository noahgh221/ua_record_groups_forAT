Faded snapshots, 3"x5" and smaller, most dating from 1931 to 1933, showing campus scenes, people and activities. Some are annotated in ink on the verso. Most were taken outdoors, but there are several taken inside dorm rooms. The campus scenes include shots of the Chapel and a number of snow scenes. The people pictured include James L. Oswald, Jr, his roommate, Harold W. Pruner, and other friends, one of whom was Pedro Amador, of Puerto Rico. The activities shown are mostly related to athletics. There are scenes of the tennis courts, the track, the baseball field, and the football stadium during a game, along with half-time shows, crowd scenes, and what appear to be homecoming displays. There are eight photos that were taken elsewhere, but are not labelled. </abstract>
