         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The University Planning Committee was constituted in October 1962. This committee served as the successor to the University Committee on Long-Range Planning. In October of 1964 the University Planning Committee combined with the University Policy Committee, forming the University Policy and Planning Advisory Committee (UPPAC). This new committee was responsible for University matters dealing with academic policy and physical planning. The UPPAC was in existence until 1969. In 1971, the University Planning Committee (UPC) was constituted by then-President Terry Sanford. The UPC was to assume the roles of the previous planning committees in that it was to “look at the past and make projections for the future in areas of enrollment, physical facilities, space, revenue sources of operating funds for the Medical Center, faculty retirement, campus plans, development, etc.” The UPC was disbanded in 1973, and reappeared the next academic year as the University Planning Commission.</p>
