         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Women's Studies was instituted at Duke University in 1983 with "a single desk in the corner of 119 East Duke, known informally as the blue parlor, with Jean O'Barr as director." Later developments saw the arrival of Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society to Duke in 1984 (Jean O'Barr as editor) and the beginning of Graduate courses in Women's Studies in 1987. The undergraduate major and minor were established in 1994. Currently (2006), The Women's Studies Program is Duke's largest interdisciplinary program. More than 75 Duke faculty members affiliate with Women's Studies.</p>
