         <p>The bulk of this collection concerns the Administrative Systems Planning Study that was coordinated by Mel Ray, the Vice-Chancellor for Data Processing. The project was a major effort to establish a system for addressing the near and long-term administrative information needs of the University. Its goals were to study Duke's administrative processes with a view toward identifying how automated information systems might best support administrative operations. The method used was similar to business systems analysis, and involved interviews with key administrators regarding their information needs, and studies of the functioning of existing manual and automated systems.</p>
