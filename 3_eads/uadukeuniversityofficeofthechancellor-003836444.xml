         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>President Emeritus R. L. Flowers was given the title of Chancellor in 1949 and the position was seemingly an honorary one. There are no records of his tenure. The office was again established in March 1969 when President D. M. Knight wanted an officer to assist with an increasing executive workload. The Chancellor was given responsibility for the internal operation of the University. Under the University By-laws of May 10, 1988, the Chancellor is an executive officer with powers and duties assigned by the President. The occupants of the office have been the following: Robert L. Flowers (1949-1951), Barnes Woodhall (1969-1970, pro tem), A. Kenneth Pye (1970-1971), John O. Blackburn (1971-1976); A. Kenneth Pye (1976-1982), and H. Keith H. Brodie (1982-1985).</p>
